# Lets Warm Up - Points: 50
# 問題文
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

# Hint
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

# 訳
ASCIIで0x70(16進数)は何ですか？

# 解法
ASCIIでは0x70は`p`です。

なので答えは
```
picoCTF{p}
```
となります。
